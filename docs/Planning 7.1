### Objectives

1. Separate program from data -- But the program is Javascript, and somewhat determined by the data. Guess that just makes the program more complex.
2. I'm worried about JS garbage collection and running out of memory on Android. Apparently I'll need to be aware of unsetting any globals that I no longer need. Admin console, and maps, use the same memory pool -- but probably not at the same time.
3. Include regions.json in each data package.
4. Maybe I need a "display" flag in regions.json so the catalog can include data that does not appear on admin console.
5. There is satellite imagry which can be common across a number of packages. Symbolic link to /library/www/html/common/assets?
6. Wanted: Local catalog of maps that are installed -- how will that be different from the data that is put in idx?
7. Color blue for work in process, green for installed maps. Hover for satellite size.
8. Move maplist/assets to <doc_root>/common/assets.
